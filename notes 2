Make a list of all paths which have an mp3 file within them
Then go through that list

So consider the alternative take the finished list go through and erase non needed directories. Question how could you possibly do that.
Go into each directory and check if there's a file
Well what if it's several chains down. It becomes a mess, there's little you can do to sort that.
There's got to be a way I can make this work but I'm not sure where to start.

We could go back to the first idea, pass a list of directories to search,
You are passing it to a system which you do not understand how it acts, it runs it's method against it self over and over.

You need to fix file util it is not returning a list of files as it was before
